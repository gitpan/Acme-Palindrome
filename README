NAME
    Acme::Palindrome - Programs are the same backward and forward

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::Palindrome;

      print "Hello world";

DESCRIPTION
    The first time you run a program under "use Acme::Palindrome", the
    module reverses the code in your source file from top to bottom, left to
    right. The code continues to work exactly as it did before, but now it
    looks like this:

      use Acme::Palindrome;

      ;"dlrow olleH" tnirp

DIAGNOSTICS
        Acme::Palindrome could not access the source file to modify it.

SEE ALSO
        Acme::Bleach - Code and documentation nearly taken verbatim.
